# AdBids

``AdBids`` example application for Tigon.

This application demonstrates how you could use Tigon to write a realtime advertisement bidding framework.

## Implementation Details

The ``AdBids`` application is primarily composed of:
 - An ``UserIdInputFlowlet`` that starts a HTTP server which accepts new user-ids for advertisers to bid on.
 - An ``AdvertiserNotificationFlowlet`` that notifies each advertiser that a user-id can be bid on and passes to them
   relevant information to make a bid.
 - Multiple ``AdvertiserFlowlet``s that run custom algorithms to make bids on user views.
 - A ``GrantBidsFlowlet`` that accepts bids from different advertisers for a particular user.
   It then grants the right to show an ad to that user to the advertiser who bids the largest amount.
   
In a Standalone Runtime Environment the granted bids are stored in an in-memory Table. In a Distributed Runtime
Environment the granted bids are stored in HBase.

## Build & Usage
 
To build ``AdBids`` jar, run:

 ```mvn clean package```

To build the jar without running the tests, run:

```mvn clean package -DskipTests```

To run the app in Standalone Runtime Environment:

 ```
 $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/AdBids-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.adbids.AdBids
 ```

This environment accepts an optional runtime argument:
 - ```bids.output.file``` Specify the file to log the granted bids to. By default granted bids are logged only to
  the console.

To run the app in Distributed Runtime Environment:
 ```
 $ ./run_distributed.sh <ZookeeperQuorum> <HDFSNamespace>
 > START /path/to/AdBids-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.adbids.AdBids --hbase.conf.path=<path-to-hbase-configuration>
 ```

Both runtimes support an additional argument:
- ```input.service.port``` Specify the port on which the server started by ``UserIdInputFlowlet`` runs. By default the 
  server runs on a random available port.

To notify the app that a user-view can be bid on, make an HTTP request to the server started by ``UserIdInputFlowlet``.

```
  POST http://<host>:<port>/id/<user-id>
```

The granted bids are logged in the following format:

```
  Bid for <user-id> granted to <advertiser-name> for $<bid-amount>.
```

## Example Usage

Make a request to the ``UserIdInputFlowlet`` notifying it that a user ``testuser``'s view can be bid on.

```
 $ curl -v -X POST http://localhost:47989/id/testuser
```

The bid granted for this user is logged as:

```
  Bid for testuser granted to TRAVEL advertiser for $12.
```
