# ClickStreamFlow 

``ClickStreamFlow`` example application for Tigon.

This app serves as a demonstration for using Tigon SQL to join 2 data streams.

In this example a view event data stream and a click event data stream are joined to generate meta information for each click event using the view even data stream. Some click events are filtered out on the basis of conditions specified in the SQL query.

## Implementation Details

The ``ClickStreamFlow`` application consists of:
 - A ``SQLInputFlowlet`` that accepts two incoming data streams of view events and click events. It then processes this data based on the provided SQL query and provides meta information for each click event using the information from the associated view event. 
 - A ``DigestFlowlet`` that accepts the output data generated by the ``SQLInputFlowlet`` and emits it to the a specified HTTP end-point as a string encoded JSON. 
 - The generated output data is logged to stdout

## Build & Usage
 
 To build the ``ClickStreamFlow`` jar, run:

     mvn clean package

 To build the jar without running the tests, run:

     mvn clean package -DskipTests

 To run the app in the Standalone Runtime Environment:

     $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/ClickStreamFlow-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.clickStream.ClickStream

 To run the app in Distributed Runtime Environment:

     $ ./run_distributed.sh /path/to/ClickStreamFlow-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.clickStream.ClickStream

Optional runtime arguments:
    - ``httpPort`` Specify the netowrk port for the HTTP data ingestion service. If not specified, Tigon automatically assigns a port. This value is always announced at runtime.
    - ``tcpPort_viewStream`` Specify the network for the TCP data ingestion service for ingesting view stream data. If not specified, Tigon automatically assigns a port. This value is always announced at runtime.
    - ``tcpPort_clickStream`` Specify the network for the TCP data ingestion service for ingesting click stream data. If not specified, Tigon automatically assigns a port. This value is always announced at runtime.

## Example Usage

To post view event data to viewStream:

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:<httpPort>/v1/tigon/viewStream -d '{ "data" : ["1","10","0","1","2","PageName1","'0':'LinkName0' - '1':'LinkName1' - '2':'LinkName2'"] }' 

To post click event data to clickStream:

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:<httpPort>/v1/tigon/clickStream -d '{ "data" : ["2","290","1"] }'
