# AdNetworkFlow

``AdNetworkFlow`` example application for Tigon.

This application demonstrates how you could use Tigon to write a real-time bidding (RTB) advertisement framework.

## Implementation Details

The ``AdNetworkFlow`` application consists of:
 - A ``UserIdInputFlowlet`` that starts an HTTP server which accepts new user-ids for advertisers to bid on. In the
   realworld, this is most often implemented as a user cookie. 
 - An ``AdvertiserNotificationFlowlet`` that notifies each advertiser that a user-id can be bid on and 
   passes to advertisers information relevant to making a bid.
 - Multiple ``AdvertiserFlowlet``s that run custom algorithms to make bids on user views.
 - A ``BidResolverFlowlet`` that accepts bids from different advertisers for a particular user.
   It then grants the right to show a user an ad to the advertiser who bids the highest amount.
   
In a Standalone Runtime Environment, the granted bids are stored in an in-memory Table. In a Distributed Runtime
Environment, the granted bids are stored in HBase.

## Build & Usage
 
To build the ``AdNetworkFlow`` jar, run:

    mvn clean package

To build the jar without running the tests, run:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

To run the app in the Standalone Runtime Environment:

    $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/AdNetworkFlow-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.adnetworkflow.AdNetworkFlow

This environment accepts an optional runtime argument:
 - ```bids.output.file``` Specify the file to log the granted bids to. By default, granted bids are logged only to
  the console.

To run the app in Distributed Runtime Environment:

    $ ./run_distributed.sh <ZookeeperQuorum> <HDFSNamespace>
    > START /path/to/AdNetworkFlow-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.apps.adnetworkflow.AdNetworkFlow --write.to.hbase=true

This environment accepts an optional runtime argument:
 - ```hbase.conf.path``` Specify the path to the HBase configuration. By default, the configuration file in the
  classpath is used.

Both runtimes support an additional argument:
- ```input.service.port``` Specify the port on which the server started by ``UserIdInputFlowlet`` runs. By default, the 
  server runs on a random available port.

To notify the app that a user-view can be bid on, make an HTTP request to the server started by ``UserIdInputFlowlet``.

    POST http://<host>:<port>/id/<user-id>

The granted bids are logged in the format:

    Bid for <user-id> granted to <advertiser-name> for $<bid-amount>.

## Example Usage

Make a request to the ``UserIdInputFlowlet``, notifying it that the views of the user ``testuser`` can be bid on.

    $ curl -v -X POST http://localhost:47989/id/testuser

The bid granted for this user is logged as:

    Bid for testuser granted to MUSIC advertiser for $15.
